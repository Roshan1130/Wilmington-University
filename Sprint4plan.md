The Sprint Plan for Week 4 is:
* Create a checkbox so it is easy for user to select courses.
* Create a button or link to the registration submission process.
* Get a confirmation page or message 

Sprint Risks:
It is possible that we get error in checkbox because it would be 1st time.

It is possible to get while getting confirmation message and pop out procedure.
