The Sprint Plan for Week 5 is:
* Create a checkbox so it is easy for user to select courses.
* Create a button or link to the registration submission process.
* Get a confirmation page or message 
* Research if viable to make a login form
* Create a full page menu for better user experience.
* Research on navigation bar, search bar, etc.

Sprint Risks:

* It is possible that we get error in checkbox because it would be 1st time.
* It is possible to get while getting confirmation message and pop out procedure.

Tasks completed on Sprint 4:
* MVP with running website, list of degrees and specific related courses.
* Got more and in-depth user stories.
