The Sprint Plan for Week 6 is:
* Work on adding header and footer
* Have a background image setup
* Work on search engine optimization for our page to be found easily
* Location based search result
* Reviwew the layout of the website.

Sprint Risks:

* The no. 1 risk would be from header and footer as we are already working on it and not getting the desired output.
* Search Engine optimization can be difficult because of lack of expertise. So, we might have to put more effort on it.
* Location based search is highly interactive program and might be difficult for a Markdown language.

Tasks completed on Sprint 5:
* The confirmation message program was created to display confirmations after each registration
* The product was featured with load time less than 15s.
* The button or link for the registration process was created.
